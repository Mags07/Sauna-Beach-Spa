# Sauna Beach Spa

Sauna Beach Spa is a new small sauna and spa B2C business located on a beautiful Garretstown beach in County Cork. The site is targeted towards people around Cork looking for a way to spend time with friends and family in a relaxing environment. 

The website provides just enough information to get people's interest without over loading them with lots of reading. Minimalist visual style offers a calming effect to the visitor with minimal clicks needed to reach the end goal of contacting the sauna. Images show relaxed guests. Soothing ocean color scheme and simple layout to make them feel like they are already there. If they feel calm just looking at the website they will more likely be convinced that this experince will offer them the ultimate relaxation.

The owner wanted the website to privide some information on the story of the business, the health benefits, the treatment options and quick way for people to contact them with enquiries. They also wanted to provide people with a sence of longing to be by the seaside getting a massage.
