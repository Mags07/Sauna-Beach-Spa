## Code Validation
### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
## Lighthouse

I used lighthouse in chrome developer tools to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - how the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - how accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best practices - how does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - search engine optimization. Is the site optimized for search engine result rankings.

## WAVE

I used wave (web accessibility evaluation tool) in chrome developer tools to test the website accessibility. Scanned website for on-page and technical accessibility issues and errors to bring site in line with recognized accessibility standards, like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
